      <h4>So... Welcome to my personal website!</h4>
      <p>
        This won't be very formal, as I'm still learning as I go about
        creating this website. There's a lot to learn, and I think doing
        this might just be a fun way to get that experience while showing
        off the little that I have.
      </p>
      <h4>What's up?</h4>
      <p>
        Well currently, I'm pretty busy with classes so I don't have as
        much freedom to explore whatever I want, but, I am trying to
        learn some react. When I'm not being distracted by other things,
        I am also trying to apply to as many internships as I can so I
        have somethign to do this summer.
